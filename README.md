# easyrpg
a free and simple rpg

## introduction
This is a quick-play tabletop RPG which can be applied to any setting. You may play this system without any prior preparation on the part of the GM or the players. You will need minimal supplies which include: a handful of six-sided dice, and something to record results on such as paper and pen.

This system was inspired by Roll for Shoes at: https://gist.github.com/brunobord/8943645

## Supplies
* Some six-sided dice (d6)
  * You can play a short game starting with about 3d6.
  * Longer sessions are better with about 4d6 per player (and the GM).
* Something to write on, and something to write with.
  * You won't generally need to erase anything during play, so don't worry about erasers.
  * You can easily record an entire party's information, and play a short game, on one index card.
  * Bonus if you have enough paper so each player can write down their information, and the GM has scratch paper for notes and whatever.

## setting the scene
Decide what the setting is. This can be done at the table, in collaboration with the players, or ahead of time if the GM has something in mind. The setting should be broad enough that the players have a lot of creative freedom, but narrow enough that each player also has a strong idea of what you're playing.

* Better setting ideas:
  * A high-fantasy world of swords, sorcery, dragons, and dungeons
  * The Year 3000, where humanity has reverted to bronze age feudalism amid ancient ruins of cities
  * The coffee shop down the corner, where our players are voices inside the head of a paranoid man who picks up government radio signals with the fillings in his teeth

* Worse setting ideas:
  * Earth (too generic - where? when?)
  * Los Angeles, AD 2100 (is this sci-fi? adventure? post-apocalypse?)
  * August 12, 2012 in the Gamestop on Pine Street when I traded in my copy of Game Bros. for store credit (probably too specific)

### resolving disputes

Try to pick a setting everyone at the table is already familiar with, so you won't have to spend too much time explaining. Setting your game world in a Japnese giant robot anime probably isn't going to work if someone at the table never read (or watched) that source material. They just won't know what sort of actions fit with this setting.

If there's any doubt or confusion, go around the table and ask each player for one idea about what they want "in" or "out". Maybe the GM suggests a game about hard-boiled cops. The players like this idea, but Player 1 asks for a rule of "No Magic". The players agree. Player 2 suggests that the area they police should be a small town, but the other players feel this is too limiting, and leave the area up to the GM. Player 3 passes. Player 4 suggests that at some point they encounter a criminal who dresses as a clown and uses clown tactics to evade pursuit. The players agree, so the GM notes that "Clown Criminal" will eventually be worked into the story.

GMs looking for tips on making scenario creation easier should read the tips found in the fantastic Microscope RPG, which is also a fantastic way to generate settings for this game: http://www.lamemage.com/microscope/

## the goal
Come up with a general goal that the players will pursue. This is generally just stated by the GM ahead of the game, but can also be discussed as a group. This will give the players some idea of what characters to create. The game doesn't necessarily have to end when you reach this goal, nor do you have to reach the goal in one session. For instance, it might not work out well if the players all make brawny fighters when the goal the GM had in mind was negotiating a delicate peacy treaty. But maybe that's the kind of game you want to have today!

* Better goals for a high-fantasy game:
  * Fight your way through the trap-filled dungeon and get the treasure
  * Rescue the Princess from the Dragon, confronting the Armies of Undead along the way
  * Confront the Dread Wizard who dominates the kingdrom from deep inside his icy lair

* Worse goals for a high-fantasy game:
  * Beat the dungeon (how? why?)
  * Rescue the prince... from his disastrous financial decisions (not really a sword-and-sorcery topic, but maybe...)
  * Achieve Mastery of the Third Circle of Magic (have you decided yet if all the players want to be wizards?)

Again, you should consult your players to make sure everyone is in general agreement about the setting and goal. If any players want to clarify any points, or add any "ins" or "outs", now is the time. If any player wants a hard veto - such as saying they don't want to rescue another princess since that's a tired trope - they should voice it now.

## character creation
### name and title
Each player should come up with a character, and summarize that character by writing down the character's name and title or a one-line description. This description should be enough to give anyone a quick idea of what kind of character this is.

* Good names for a high fantasy game:
  * Dirk the Dagger, Master Of Thievery
  * Alina Spellsong, Sorceress Supreme
  * The Undying Faceless One, Taker of Souls

* Worse names for a high fantasy game, which you should run by your GM first:
  * Dave (too short)
  * Makheesi, Mother of Balrogs, Slayer of the Tainted, Breaker of Forth Walls, and Master of the Seventeen Arts (too long)
  * Captain I Always Win Every Fight (Your name doesn't allow you to dictate how the game works)
  * The Girl Who Wields Excalibur (it's fine to name your favorite weapon, but you don't get any bonuses on your rolls)
  * Xyrr-X, the Space Alien (ask the group first first, before introducing something that might not fit the setting)

### do something
Each charater starts with one first-level skill:
* Do Something 1

In short, your character can attempt anything you'd like them to do. Anything your character does is considered to be of totally average skill. As you play the game, you will develop more specific skills which will allow you to perform better than average.

## core mechanic: opposed rolls
* A player can always "Do Something 1", meaning you can roll 1 die to have the character perform any action
  * Note that this should only involve heroic, difficult, or risky actions. You don't have to roll dice to breathe or walk, under normal circumstances.
* Most of the time, something will oppose your roll. This could be an enemy, a lock, chance, or just physics.
* If you are competing with another player, such as two characters are having a footrace, that player may roll an appropriate skill to oppose you. Whoever rolls the highest, wins.
  * If the result is a tie, that's usually a valid result. Two character running toward a goal arrive at the same time. If they want to shove each other at the last minute to fight for the win, that's another roll.
* If you are trying to do a difficult action that doesn't directly oppose another player, the GM should announce how difficult that action is and roll that number of dice against you.
  * You must roll MORE THAN the opposing roll to win. Ties usually indicate failure. A tie on an attack roll is always a miss.
  * For instance, if you're trying to "Walk a Tightrope", your GM may say that on this windy day that you're going to face 3d6 of difficulty. If you're using your skill Do Something 1 against 3d6 of difficulty, you have to roll a 4 or higher to have any possibility of success.

*** Quick Difficulty Ideas (in a High-fantasy Game)
You can convey the difficulty of a situation however you want, but here's a ready-made chart:
* 1d6: Easy. Untrained people often - but not always - get this right on the first try.
  * Balancing on a rail, hitting an unarmed enemy with a sword.
* 2d6: Medium. An untrained person usually don't get this right on the first try.
  * Balancing on a rickety bridge swaying in the wind, hitting an unarmored enemy who has a shield.
* 3d6: Hard. Usually requires training to even attempt.
  * Walking a tightrope, damaging an enemy through full plate mail.
* 4d6: Heroic. Actions most people don't even attempt.
  * Juggling while walking a tightrope, swordfighting a skilled enemy in full plate.
* 4d6: Legendary. Actions even skilled people wouldn't normally attempt
  * Juggling knives while walking a frayed rope that's on fire, swordfighting a golem made out of swords.
* 6d6+ Impossible. It is impossible for a starting character to ever complete this action, no matter how hard they try. Even if they roll a 6, the GM can't roll lower than 6 with 6d6.
  * This is left up to the GM, but can be a placeholder for feats such as attempting to jump over a building in a single bound.

## core mechanic: leveling up skills
If you roll all 6's on a skill, you gain a new skill of the next level related to that action.
* If you "Do Something" and roll a 6, you gain a permanent new skill or effect related to that action.
  * If you are trying to Do Something (kick down a door) and roll a 6, maybe you're "Good at Kicking Doors 2" or wearing "Boots of Kicking 2"
* If you were rolling a Skill at level 2 or higher, create a new skill that captures the essence of this extra power. The fastest way to accomplish this is to add an adjective for each level.
  * If you roll your "Boots of Kicking 2" and get all 6's, maybe a spray of flame reveals the "Fiery Boots of Kicking 3", or the "Boots of Mighty Kicking 3"
  * You can also just come up with an extra-awesome descriptor. Perhaps the magic spell "Ice Missile 2" becomes "Bolt of Cold 3", and then "Modekaider's Icy Missile 4"
  
## Appendix 1: Advanced Rules

### power level
Power level is a general term for how strong the PCs are. There's a big difference between playing normal humans versus superheros. There are a few ways to alter the power level of your game to your liking.
* Flavor
  * Make sure your players understand the general level of things their "Do Something 1" skill can accomplish. "Do Something 1" is going to be very different depending on whether the characters are human peasants, or superbeings from Mars.
  * By allowing your skills to have more or less ridiculous descriptors, you automatically raise or lower the pervieved power level of your game. If you skills tend to be "Kicking 2" or "Knows about Computers 2" you're communicating a lower power level. Skills such as "Super Strength 2" and "Master Hacker 2" and it communicate a higher power level. Try to make sure players are picking skills that match your intended power level.
* Starting Skills
  * You may allow your characters to start off with some free skills. Perhaps Superkid starts off with "Laser Vision 2" and "Flight 2". This may also be used to allow someone who missed a session to catch up to the other players. I would suggest two level 2 skills and one level 3 skill so your characters start with a solid idea of who they are portraying.
* Free 6s
  * You can allow the players some sort of currency for getting more free 6s, which allow them to succeed more and gain higher levels of skill. See the section on Free 6s for more info.
  
### free 6s, tokens for faster advancement
As you go up in skill levels, it gets exponentially more difficult to roll new skills. At level 2 (trying to get a level 3 skill), you will roll all 6s to get a new skill only 2.78% of the time. For a quck, throwaway game that's probably fine. Past that point, most players are going to want a system to make higher-level skills a little more attainable. Here are a few ideas. All of these ideas work best if you gather some tokens before playing your game, such as poker chips, that you can hand out as currency. I recommend the "Good Roleplaying" award below.
* Before the game, gather some tokens that can be handed to players. You can use anything that stays in one place such as poker chips, or candy (candy is a fun one - hand out a lot of them and see if players can resist eating them long enough to spend them!).
* Players may redeem their tokens at any time to change the result of any single die to a 6. If this makes all the dice 6s, the character gains a new skill as normal.
* The GM can hand out tokens for:
  * Good Roleplaying. Anyone who comes up with creative, funny, or interesting ideas during the game gets rewarded with one token per instance.
  * Participation Trophy. Gain a token for every successful roll that doesn't result in a new skill. This encourages players to roll as much as possible, so the GM should make sure no single player is spamming rolls just to acquire tokens.
  * Karmic Balance. Anytime a player fails a roll, they get a token. This can ensure that players who are getting particularly bad luck don't get left behind. This may encourage players to take more risks where they are likely to fail, so the GM should make sure players aren't constantly attempting impossible tasks just to gain tokens.

### optional mechanic: the skill tree
During short, single games your characters won't generate that many skills. In longer campaigns where you hand out tokens, the possible skills will really start to add up. I suggest a skill tree in order to maintain a balance between the number and level of skills a character has. The basic idea is that you can only have so many skills, and if you want to add new skills, you'd have to overwrite (cross out) old ones. I suggest using both of the below systems together - the ladder and the triangle. This is similar to how skills are handled in the FATE Core system https://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core/.

#### skill tree: triangle
You can only take a maximum of five skills at level 2, four skills at level 3, up to one level 6 skill. If you want to add more skills to a level, you have to overwrite an existing skill. GMs: You may change this number up or down to your taste.

#### skill tree: ladder
Other than the Do Something 1 skill, you can never take more skill points at any level than you have at the level before that. For instance, you cannot have more level 3 skills than you have level 2 skills. The ladder is most useful if you're handing out a lot of tokens for free 6s, and players are always saving up for high-level skills. Example ladders:

* Bille the Kidd
  * (Do Something 1)
  * Six-shooter 2, Quickdraw 2, Riding 2
  * Lightning Quickdraw: 3, Trick Riding: 3
  * Deadly Lightning Quickdraw: 4
  * (...and it is currently valid to add a new skill at any level)

* Marjoram the Magician
  * (Do Something 1)
  * Magic Missile 2, Color Spray 2
  * Magic Multi-Missile 3, Dazzling Color Spray 3
  * Superior Magic Multi-Missile 4, Dazzling Prismatic Color Spray 4
  * (...but you can't add any new skills at level 2 or 3 without replacing something, or adding more skills at lower levels first)

Example of an incorrect skill ladder:

* Cheaty McCheat
  * (Do Something 1)
  * Cheat: 2
  * Big Cheat: 3, Cheaty Cheat: 3
  * (There are more skills at level 3 than there are at level 2)

You can never advance a higher-level skill if you break any link in its chain, so overwriting Dazzling Color Spray 3 means that you can never again advance Dazzling Prismatic Color Spray 4 to a level 5 skill.

#### skill tree: the triangle and the ladder
Combines the above. Here's a quick example of the maximum possible skills a character can attain:
* Mento the Most Boring Elemental Magician
  * (Do Something 1)
  * Fire Bolt 2, Ice Bolt 2, Lightning Bolt 2, Earth Bolt 2, Prismatic Bolt 2
  * Fire Bolt 3, Ice Bolt 3, Lightning Bolt 3, Earth Bolt 3
  * Fire Bolt 4, Ice Bolt 4, Lightning Bolt 4
  * Fire Bolt 5, Ice Bolt 5
  * Fire Bolt 6
Let's assume Mento keeps adventuring until he rolls all 6s on his "Ice Bolt 5" skill and really wants to add a level 6 ice skill. Mento would have to overwrite his "Fire Bolt 6" with his new "Ice Bolt 6", if he wishes to do so.

## appendix 2: terminology
* d6, or 1d6, 2d6, etc.
  * Six-sided dice, or cubes numbered 1-6 on their sides. "d6" and "1d6" mean one six-sided die. "2d6" and so on means that number of six-sided dice. If you see a term such as "2d6+1", that means take the result of rolling 2d6 and add 1 to the total.
* GM
  * GameMaster. The person running the game. There is one GM per game.
* NPC
  * Non-Player Character. Some fictional entity in the game world, such as a monster or townsperson. Generally portrayed by the GM.
* PC
  * Player-Character, or the imaginary character that one of your players is portraying.

## appendix 3: quick sheet
* GM leads tasks prior to play
  * Announce the setting, and discuss any "ins" and "outs" the players want so you're all on the same page.
  * Announce the general goal the characters are aiming for, so the players know roughly what they're aiming at.
  * Players create characters. Characters generaly, have a name, title, and the skill "Do Something 1"
* Players, during play:
  * Say what you do and roll a number of d6s.
  * If the sum of your roll is higher than the opposing roll (either another player or the DM), the thing you wanted to happen, happens.
  * The number of the d6s you roll is determined by the level of skill you have.
  * If you roll all sixes on your roll, you can get new skill one level higher than the one you used for the action.
  * Note that these skills may also represent items, techniques, etc. that your character uses to gain an advantage.
  * The skill must be a subset of what happened to you in the action (Say, Athletics 2 if you were climbing a wall, or Teeth of Biting 2 if you were eating a cake).
