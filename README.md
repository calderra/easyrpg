# easyrpg
a free and simple rpg

## introduction
This is a quick-play RPG. The idea is that you don't need to do any preparation before running a game. The rules can be explained to players in only a few minutes, and you need a minimum of supplies to play (some six-sided dice, paper, and pen). This guide assumes you're familiar with common terms in modern tabletop RPGs, such as "2d6". If you need assistance, there's a short section at the end explaining terms.

This system is totally agnostic as to what setting, power levels, etc. that you choose to portray. Want to play superheros in a cartoon world? Great. Sword-and-sorcery dungeon crawls? Can do. Bums who fight over who gets to wear the nice shoes you just saw on the street? Got it.

## You will be able to play a full campaign with only these supplies:
* Some six-sided dice (d6)
  * Having at least 4or 5 six-sided dice (4d6 or 5d6) will be plenty for one session.
  * Bonus if you can supply about 4d6 per player (and the GM too)
* Something to write on, and something to write with.
  * At minimum, you'll need to write down each character's name and skills.
  * You won't generally need to erase anything during play, so don't worry about erasers.
  * You can easily record an entire party's information, and play a full game, on one index card.
  * Bonus if you can supply some paper to each player, and if the GM has some scratch paper for notes and maps and whatever.

## world creation
Decide what the setting is. This can be done at the table, in collaboration with the players, or ahead of time if the GM has something in mind. The setting should be broad enough that the players have a lot of creative freedom, but narrow enough that each player also has a strong idea of what you're playing.

* Better setting ideas:
  * A high-fantasy world of swords, sorcery, dragons, and dungeons
  * The Year 3000, on the Desert Planet Sandhill, where humanity has reverted to bronze age feudalism
  * An alternate dimension, that's just like sitting here now, except an apocalyptic meteor hits the earth and suddenly we have superpowers

* Worse setting ideas:
  * Earth (too generic - where? when?)
  * Los Angeles, AD 2100 (is this sci-fi? adventure? post-apocalypse?)
  * August 12, 2012 in the Gamestop on Pine Street when I traded in my copy of Game Bros. for store credit (probably too specific)

### world creation tips and tricks

If you generate the world at the table, make sure you consult each player individually to ask if they're okay playing that type of game. The GM may want to jot down a few notes if there's any disagreement among players.

In general, try to pick a setting everyone at the table is familiar with. Your game might take place in a Lord of the Rings type fantasy world, a science-fiction future, or anything else you wish.

If there's any doubt or confusion, go around the table and ask each player for one idea about what they want "out" or "in". Maybe the GM suggests a game about hard-boiled cops. The players like this idea, but Player 1 asks for a rule of "No Magic". The players agree. Player 2 suggests that the setting should be a small town, but the other players feel this is too limiting, and leave the setting up to the GM. Player 3 passes. Player 4 would like it if at some point they encounter a criminal who dresses as a clown and uses clown tactics to evade pursuit. The players agree, so the GM notes that "Clown Criminal" is in.

There are two great rules to make world creation fast and easy: Anyone can propose any idea (and the players should take it seriously), and anyone can pull a hard veto if the don't like an idea. You should always discuss ideas together, but if one player is particularly for or against an idea, you should all try to work that in.

## the goal
Come up with a general goal that the players will pursue. This is generally stated by the GM. This will give the players some idea of what characters to create. The game doesn't necessarily have to end when you reach this goal, nor do you have to reach the goal in one session. For instance, it might not work out well if the players all make brawny fighters when the goal the GM had in mind was negotiating a delicate peacy treaty.

* Better goals for a high-fantasy game:
  * Fight your way through the trap-filled dungeon and get the treasure
  * Rescue the Princess from the Dragon, confronting the Armies of Undead along the way
  * Confront the Dread Wizard who dominates the kingdrom from deep inside his icy lair

* Worse goals for a high-fantasy game:
  * Beat the dungeon (how? why?)
  * Rescue the prince... from his disastrous financial decisions (not really a sword-and-sorcery topic, but maybe...)
  * Achieve Mastery of the Third Circle of Magic (have you decided yet if all the characters are mages?)

Again, you should consult your players to make sure everyone is in general agreement about the setting and goal. If any players want to clarify any points, or add any "ins" or "outs", now is the time. If any player wants a hard veto - such as saying they don't want to rescue another princess since that's a tired trope - they should voice it now.

## character creation
### name and title
Have each player write down their character's name or title. It's helpful to be descriptive. This name should quickly explains you character concept, and possibly their motivation. When in doubt, run your concept or your name by the GM first just to make sure it fits the setting and intent. Anything else about your character - such as what they're wearing or carrying - is totally up to you, so long as it fits the setting. Note that at this point, nothing you're carrying changes your dice rolls, so a "dagger" is the same as a "+5 Flaming Mace", and you should focus more on making sure your equipment is appropriate to the setting.

* Good names for a high fantasy game:
** Dirk the Dagger, Master Of Thievery
** Alina Spellsong, Sorceress Supreme
** The Undying Faceless One, Taker of Souls

* Names you definitely need to run by your GM first:
** Makheesi, Mother of Balrogs, Slayer of the Tainted, Breaker of Forth Walls, Unrepentant, Unshaven, and Master of the Seventeen Arts (too long)
** Dave (too short)
** Captain I Always Win Every Fight (Your name doesn't allow you to dictate how the game works)

### do something
Each charater starts with one first-level skill:
* Do Something 1

In short, your character can attempt anything you'd like them to do. Anything your character does is considered to be of totally average skill. As you play the game, you will develop more specific skills which will allow you to perform better than average.

## core mechanic: opposed rolls
* Your character can always "Do Something", meaning you can roll 1 die to perform any action
  * State the action, and if your character isn't opposed by an outside force, this action always succeeds.
  * For instance, you don't have to roll to "Put on my Pants". No matter how long you may have to struggle, we may safely assume that you will vanquish this task with the proper effort.
* Most of the time, something will oppose your roll. This could be an enemy, fate, or just physics.
  * If you are trying to do a difficult action, the GM should announce how difficult that action is, and roll that number of dice against you.
  * For instance, if you're trying to "Walk a Tightrope", your GM may say that on this windy day that's 
  
*** Quick Difficulty Ideas (in a High-fantasy Game)
You can convey the difficulty of a situation however you want, but here's a quick idea for inspiration. If the GM will be rolling against you with:
* 1d6: Easy. Untrained people often - but not alway - get this right on the first try. Balancing on a rail, hitting an unarmed enemy with a sword.
* 2d6: Medium. An untrained person usually don't get this right on the first try. Balancing on a rickety bridge swaying in the wind, hitting an unarmored enemy who has a shield.
* 3d6: Hard. Usually requires training to even attempt. Walking a tightrope, damaging an enemy through full plate mail.
* 4d6: Heroic. Actions most people don't even attempt. Juggling while walking a tightrope, swordfighting a skilled enemy in full plate.
* 4d6: Legendary. Actions even skilled people wouldn't normally attempt. Juggling knives while walking a frayed rope that's on fire, swordfighting a golem made out of swords.
* 6d6+ Impossible. It is impossible for a starting character to ever complete this action, no matter how hard they try. This is left up to the GM, but can sarcastically be a placeholder for feats such as attempting to jump over a castle in a single bound.

## core mechanic: leveling up skills
If you roll all 6's on a skill, you gain a new skill of the next level related to that action.
* If you "Do Something" and roll a 6, you gain a permanent new skill or effect related to that action.
  * If you are trying to Do Something (kick down a door) and roll a 6, maybe you're "Good at Kicking Doors 2" or wearing "Boots of Kicking 2"
* If you were rolling a Skill at level 2 or higher, create a new spell that captures the essence of this extra power. The fastest way to accomplish this, is to add an adjective for each level.
  * If you roll your "Boots of Kicking 2" and get all 6's, maybe a spray of flame reveals the "Fiery Boots of Kicking 3", or the "Mighty Boots of Kicking 3"
  * You can also just come up with an extra-awesome descriptor. Perhaps the "Boots of Kicking 2" become the "Spring-Boots of Moldor 3", and then the "Mighty Ice Boots of Stomp 4"

### optional mechanic: the skill tree
During short, single games your characters won't generate that many skills. However, in longer campaigns, the possible skills will really start to add up. I suggest a skill tree in order to maintain a balance between the number and level of skills a character has. The basic idea is that you can only have so many skills, and if you want to add new skills, you'd have to overwrite (cross out) old ones.

#### Skill Tree 1: The Ladder
You can never take more skill points at any level, than you have at the level before that. (Ignore the Do Something 1 skill). If you generate a new skill at a level where you can't add any more, you have to 

* Bille the Kidd
** (Do Something 1)
** Six-shooter 2, Quickdraw 2, Riding 2
** Lightning Quickdraw: 3, Trick Riding: 3
** Deadly Lightning Quickdraw: 4
** (...and it is currently valid to add a new skill at any level)

* Marjoram the Magician
** (Do Something 1)
** Magic Missile 2, Color Spray 2
** Magic Multi-Missile 3, Dazzling Color Spray 3
** Superior Magic Multi-Missile 4, Dazzling Prismatic Color Spray 4
** (...but you can't add any new skills at level 2 or 3 without replacing something, or adding more skills at lower levels first)

Example of an incorrect character:

* Cheaty McCeat Cheater
** (Do Something 1)
** Cheat: 2
** Big Cheat: 3, Cheaty Cheat: 3
** (There are more skills at level 3 than there are at level 2)

You can never advance a higher-level skill if you break any link in its chain, so overwriting Dazzling Color Spray 3 means that you can never again advance Dazzling Prismatic Color Spray 4 to a level 5 skill.

#### Skill Tree 2: The Triangle
You can only take up to a maximum of 6 skills at level 2, 5 skills at level 3, and so on. If you want to add more skills to a level, you have to overwrite an existing skill. You may change this number up or down to your taste. You can never advance a higher-level skill if you break any link in its chain, so overwriting Dazzling Color Spray 3 means that you can never advance Dazzling Prismatic Color Spray 4 to a level 5 skill.

## advanced rules

### power level
There are a few ways to alter the power level of your game.
* Flavor
** By allowing your tags to have more or less ridiculous descriptors, you automatically raise or lower the pervieved power level of your game.
** For a low-fantasy setting, a character may start with "Swordplay: 1"

## terminology
* d6, or 1d6, 2d6, etc.
  * Six-sided dice, or cubes numbered 1-6 on their sides. "d6" and "1d6" mean one six-sided die. "2d6" and so on means that number of six-sided dice. If you see a term such as "2d6+1", that means take the result of rolling 2d6 and add 1 to the total.
* GM
  * GameMaster. The person running the game. There is one GM per game.
* NPC
  * Non-Player Character. Some fictional entity in the game world, such as a monster or townsperson. Generally portrayed by the GM.
* PC
  * Player-Character, or the imaginary character that one of your players is portraying.
