## a free and simple rpg

## introduction
This is a quick-play RPG. The idea is that you don't need to do any preparation before running a game. The rules can be explained to players in only a few minutes, and you need a minimum of supplies to play (some six-sided dice and paper). This guide assumes you're familiar with common terms in modern RPGs, such as "1d6". If you need assistance, there's a short section at the end explaining terms.

This system is totally agnostic as to what setting, power levels, etc. that you choose to portray. Want to play superheros in a cartoon world? Great. Sword-and-sorcery dungeon crawls? Can do. Bums who fight over who gets to wear the nice shoes you just saw on the street? Got it.

## You will be able to play a full campaign with only these supplies:
* Some six-sided dice (d6)
  * Having at least 4or 5 six-sided dice (4d6 or 5d6) will be plenty for one session.
  * Bonus if you can supply about 4d6 per player (and the GM too)
* Something to write on, and something to write with.
  * At minimum, you'll need to write down each character's name and skills.
  * You won't generally need to erase anything during play, so don't worry about erasers.
  * You can easily record an entire party's information, and play a full game, on one index card.
  * Bonus if you can supply some paper to each player, and if the GM has some scratch paper for notes and maps and whatever.

## world creation
Decide what the setting is. This can be done at the table, in collaboration with the players, or ahead of time if the GM has something in mind. The setting should be broad enough that the players have a lot of creative freedom, but narrow enough that each player also has a strong idea of what you're playing.

* Better setting ideas:
  * A high-fantasy world of swords, sorcery, dragons, and dungeons
  * The Year 3000, on the Desert Planet Sandhill, where humanity has reverted to bronze age feudalism
  * An alternate dimension, that's just like sitting here now, except an apocalyptic meteor hits the earth and suddenly we have superpowers

* Worse setting ideas:
  * Earth (too generic - where? when?)
  * Los Angeles, AD 2100 (is this sci-fi? adventure? post-apocalypse?)
  * August 12, 2012 in the Gamestop on Pine Street when I traded in my copy of Game Bros. for store credit (probably too specific)

### world creation tips and tricks

If you generate the world at the table, make sure you consult each player individually to ask if they're okay playing that type of game. The GM may want to jot down a few notes if there's any disagreement among players.

In general, try to pick a setting everyone at the table is familiar with. Your game might take place in a Lord of the Rings type fantasy world, a science-fiction future, or anything else you wish.

If there's any doubt or confusion, go around the table and ask each player for one idea about what they want "out" or "in". Maybe the GM suggests a game about hard-boiled cops. The players like this idea, but Player 1 asks for a rule of "No Magic". The players agree. Player 2 suggests that the setting should be a small town, but the other players feel this is too limiting, and leave the setting up to the GM. Player 3 passes. Player 4 would like it if at some point they encounter a criminal who dresses as a clown and uses clown tactics to evade pursuit. The players agree, so the GM notes that "Clown Criminal" is in.

There are two great rules to make world creation fast and easy: Anyone can propose any idea (and the players should take it seriously), and anyone can pull a hard veto if the don't like an idea. You should always discuss ideas together, but if one player is particularly for or against an idea, you should all try to work that in.

## the goal
Come up with a general goal that the players will pursue. This is generally stated by the GM. This will give the players some idea of what characters to create. The game doesn't necessarily have to end when you reach this goal, nor do you have to reach the goal in one session. For instance, it might not work out well if the players all make brawny fighters when the goal the GM had in mind was negotiating a delicate peacy treaty.

* Better goals for a high-fantasy game:
  * Fight your way through the trap-filled dungeon and get the treasure
  * Rescue the Princess from the Dragon, confronting the Armies of Undead along the way
  * Confront the Dread Wizard who dominates the kingdrom from deep inside his icy lair

* Worse goals for a high-fantasy game:
  * Beat the dungeon (how? why?)
  * Rescue the prince... from his disastrous financial decisions (not really a sword-and-sorcery topic, but maybe...)
  * Achieve Mastery of the Third Circle of Magic (have you decided yet if all the characters are mages?)

Again, you should consult your players to make sure everyone is in general agreement about the setting and goal. If any players want to clarify any points, or add any "ins" or "outs", now is the time. If any player wants a hard veto - such as saying they don't want to rescue another princess since that's a tired trope - they should voice it now.

## character creation
Have each player write down their character's name or title. It's helpful to be descriptive. This name should quickly explains you character concept, and possibly their motivation. When in doubt, run your concept or your name by the GM first just to make sure it fits the setting and intent. Anything else about your character - such as what they're wearing or carrying - is totally up to you, so long as it fits the setting. Note that at this point, nothing you're carrying changes your dice rolls, so a "dagger" is the same as a "+5 Flaming Mace", and you should focus more on making sure your equipment is appropriate to the setting.

* Good names for a high fantasy game:
** Dirk the Dagger, Master Of Thievery
** Alina Spellsong, Sorceress Supreme
** The Undying Faceless One, Taker of Souls

* Names you definitely need to run by your GM first:
** Makheesi, Mother of Balrogs, Slayer of the Tainted, Breaker of Forth Walls, Unrepentant, Unshaven, and Master of the Seventeen Arts (too long)
** Dave (too short)
** Captain I Always Win Every Fight (Your name doesn't allow you to dictate how the game works)

## do something
Each charater starts with one first-level skill:
* Do Something 1

In short, your character can attempt anything you'd like them to do. Anything your character does is considered to be of totally average skill. As you play the game, you will develop more specific skills which will allow you to perform better than average.

## core mechanic: add up the dice
* At any time, your character can perform any of the actions listed on your character sheet.

* Your character automatically does the 
* To perform an action, roll a specified number of dice. Add up the total. At the same time, the GM or another player will make their own roll depending on what foce opposes you.


## the skill tree
This game utilizes a skill tree in order to maintain a balance between the number and level of skills a character has. In short, you can never take more skill points at any level, than you have at the level before that. Ignore the 0-level Do Something skill.

* Bille the Kidd
** (Do Something 1)
** Six-shooter 1, Quickdraw 1, Riding 1
** Lightning Quickdraw: 2, Trick Riding: 2
** Deadly Lightning Quickdraw: 3
** Shortlist: Deadly Lightning Quickdraw: 3, Trick Riding 2, Six-shooter: 1

* Marjoram the Magician
** (Do Something 1)
** Magic Missile 1, Color Spray 1
** Magic Multi-Missile 2, Dazzling Color Spray 2
** Superior Magic Multi-Missile 3, Dazzling Prismatic Color Spray 3
** Shortlist: Superior Magic Multi-Missile 3, Dazzling Prismatic Color Spray 3

Example of an incorrect character:

* Cheaty McCeat Cheater
** (Do Something: 0)
** Cheat: 1
** Big Cheat: 2, Cheaty Cheat: 2
** SHORT: CHEATER.

## advanced rules

### power level
There are a few ways to alter the power level of your game.
* Flavor
** By allowing your tags to have more or less ridiculous descriptors, you automatically raise or lower the pervieved power level of your game.
** For a low-fantasy setting, a character may start with "Swordplay: 1"

## terminology
* d6, or 1d6, 2d6, etc.
  * Six-sided dice, or cubes numbered 1-6 on their sides. "d6" and "1d6" mean one six-sided die. "2d6" and so on means that number of six-sided dice. If you see a term such as "2d6+1", that means take the result of rolling 2d6 and add 1 to the total.
* GM
  * GameMaster. The person running the game. There is one GM per game.
* NPC
  * Non-Player Character. Some fictional entity in the game world, such as a monster or townsperson. Generally portrayed by the GM.
* PC
  * Player-Character, or the imaginary character that one of your players is portraying.
